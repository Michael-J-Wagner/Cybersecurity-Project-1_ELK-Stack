- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._

- Create an Ansible playbook that installs Docker and configures an ELK container.
- Run the playbook to launch the container.
- Navigate to the ELK serverâ€™s GUI to view Filebeat installation instructions.
- Create a Filebeat configuration file.
- Create an Ansible playbook that copies this configuration file to the DVWA VMs and then installs Filebeat.
- Run the playbook to install Filebeat.
- Confirm that the ELK Stack is receiving logs.
- Use the same method to install Metricbeat.

1. In your provisioner VM, open a Terminal window and copy the playbook files from this GitHub repository that you wish to run using `curl`.

- Elk Server playbook:
```
curl https://github.com/Michael-J-Wagner/Cybersecurity-Project-1_ELK-Stack/blob/main/Ansible/02-config-elk-server-with-docker.yml > /etc/ansible/files/elk-config.yml
```

- Filebeat playbook:
```
curl https://github.com/Michael-J-Wagner/Cybersecurity-Project-1_ELK-Stack/blob/main/Ansible/03-filebeat-playbook.yml > /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-config.yml
```

- Metricbeat playbook:
```
curl https://github.com/Michael-J-Wagner/Cybersecurity-Project-1_ELK-Stack/blob/main/Ansible/04-metricbeat-playbook.yml > /etc/ansible/files/metricbeat-config.yml
```

2. In your provisioner VM, add the IP addresses of your ELK server and the Web servers to be monitored to Ansible's hosts file at `/etc/ansible/hosts`:

```
[elkserver]
10.1.0.4 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

[webservers]
10.0.0.5 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
10.0.0.6 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
10.0.0.7 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
```

## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network shown below.

![Azure Cloud Infrastructure Diagram](Diagrams/Wagner,_Michael_-_Azure_Cloud_Infrastructure_Diagram.png)

These files were tested and used to build a live ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) deployment on
the Azure cloud platform. They can be used to recreate the entire deployment pictured above, or select portions of
the [Ansible playbook files](./Ansible/) can be run to install specific features, such as Metricbeat.

This document contains the following details:

- Access Policies
- ELK Configuration

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the
D\*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be both highly available and responsive,
in addition to restricting access to the frontend IP addresses of the virtual network.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor vulnerable virtual machines for changes to
the file system and to analyze system metrics.

The configuration details of each machine are found below.

| Name                           | Function   | IP Address | Operating System    |
|:-------------------------------|:-----------|:-----------|:--------------------|
| Red-Team--Jump-Box-Provisioner | Gateway    | 10.0.0.4   | Linux: Ubuntu 18.04 |
| Red-Team--Web-Server-1         | Web Server | 10.0.0.5   | Linux: Ubuntu 18.04 |
| Red-Team--Web-Server-2         | Web Server | 10.0.0.6   | Linux: Ubuntu 18.04 |
| Red-Team--Web-Server-3         | Web Server | 10.0.0.7   | Linux: Ubuntu 18.04 |
| Project-ELK--Server            | ELK Server | 10.1.0.4   | Linux: Ubuntu 18.04 |

---

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet.
They can only be accessed by the Jump Box machine, which is the only VM that can accept connections from the Internet.
Access to this machine is allowed only from the developer's workstation.

The table below summarizes the access policies in place.

| Name                           | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses               |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| Red-Team--Jump-Box-Provisioner | Yes                 | Developer's workstation            |
| Red-Team--Web-Server-1         | No                  | 10.0.0.4                           |
| Red-Team--Web-Server-2         | No                  | 10.0.0.4                           |
| Red-Team--Web-Server-3         | No                  | 10.0.0.4                           |
| Project-ELK--Server            | No                  | 10.0.0.4 & Developer's workstation |

### ELK Configuration

The open source IT engine Ansible was used to automate the configuration of the ELK server.
No configuration was performed manually.
Automating server configuration in this way has many advantages, such as:

- Consistency: Server configurations from simple to complex can be precisely deployed every time
- Efficiency: Easily-run Ansible playbooks reduce the effort required to create multiple environments and set up / update their applications
- Simplicity: Users can get up to speed and be productive quickly, eliminating repetitive tasks that take time and can cause errors

The [ELK server playbook](./Ansible/02-config-elk-server-with-docker.yml) performs the following tasks:

- Installs Docker
- Installs the pip package management system
- Increases the memory size of the VMs
- Downloads and launches the ELK container
- Enables the Docker service to run on boot

The following screenshot displays the result of running `sudo docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK deployment.

### Target Machines & Beats

The ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
| Name                   | IP Address |
| :--------------------- | :--------- |
| Red-Team--Web-Server-1 | 10.0.0.5   |
| Red-Team--Web-Server-2 | 10.0.0.6   |
| Red-Team--Web-Server-3 | 10.0.0.7   |

The following Beats (open source data shippers) have been installed on these machines:
- Filebeat
- Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat: Monitors log files, collects events, and forwards / centralizes log data
- Metricbeat: Monitors servers by collecting metrics from the operating system and every process running on the system

The data collected by these two Beats is used to build and share dashboards in Kibana that visualize system-level CPU usage,
memory, file system, disk IO, network IO statistics, and more.

### Using the Playbooks

In order to use the playbooks you will need to have configured an Ansible control node. Assuming a control node has
been provisioned, SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
