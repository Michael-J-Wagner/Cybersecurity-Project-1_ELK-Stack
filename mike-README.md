These files were tested and used to build a live ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) deployment on
the Azure cloud platform. They can be used to recreate the entire deployment pictured above, or select portions of
the [Ansible playbook files](./Ansible/) can be run to install specific features, such as Metricbeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the
D\*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be both highly available and responsive,
in addition to restricting access to the frontend IP addresses of the virtual network.
